# go-get-gopher

A quick script to scrape images, from Go repositories in order to help me find Gopher mascots.

## TODO

- [ ] Change search logic to bypass Github 1000 limit, using created date
- [ ] Add logic for filtering out images that cannot be Gopher mascot logos
- [ ] Add the image downloader and review tool
